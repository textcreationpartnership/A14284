            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2821:9"/> doubt, whether Faith &amp; Works, or Faith onely iuſtifieth, To the firſt I anſwere, that your great griefes &amp; perturbations in ſoule and conſcience, are not argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or notes of reprobation, but rather of Faith &amp; of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which is begunne in you: For by how much you haue the ſenſe and féeling of your ſins, by ſo much the more you haue the aſſurance of mercy: as hée who hath the ſenſe and féeling of his naturall diſeaſe, hath ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he is not in danger of death. And by how much dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the diſeaſe of the body is found to be, ſo much the more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and bitter a coroſiue muſt be vſed, but firſt a Coraſiue, then a Lenitiue: Euen ſo, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the holy Phyſitian, heales the ſoules of great ſinners, by ſuffering them to call, to cry, to vexe, to grieue, and euen to roare with the ſurpaſſing greatneſſe therof, and afterwards when the extremitie and bitterneſſe of the paſſion is paſt, then hée heares,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2821:10"/> then hée grants, and then hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues to mercy, vſing therein the practiſe of a good naturall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, who miniſtreth not medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to a maladye when it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and at the worſt, but when it is ſomewhat mitigated, aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and abated. And it is iuſtice with God to doe ſometimes as hée is done vnto: he cals &amp; cryes earely and late, and man will not heare: he offers mercy earely and late, &amp; yet man will not eſtéeme of it. No maruell then if man call and cry, and God will not heare him, if man call and cry for mercy, and God will not by and by heare him. Hope confidently in Gods mercy, conſtantly and reſolutely abide therefore, and wait the Lords leaſure, be ſtrong and he ſhall comfort thy heart.</p>
                  <p>You haue the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> of <hi>Ezekias,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, who called, who cryed, who wept and roared bitterly, who hoped in God and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, at laſt the Lord heard them.

That faith onely iuſtifieth <hi>Paul</hi> hauing no good worke, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being full of guile and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, as his owne ſtory ſets forth, was iuſtified by faith only: which makes him in great humility and thankfulneſſe to preach the ſame, in all that his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> and in many places of his other Epiſtles to the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. S. <hi>Iames</hi> in his Epiſtle ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicall writes no leſſe, when as he ſaith;<note place="margin">Iames 2.15</note> 
                     <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes:</hi> meaning workes that follow a true iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, and not workes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed as iuſtifying with Faith.

                     <hi>If there be no reſurrection, then are we of all men moſt miſerable:</hi> euen ſo if faith and workes doe iuſtifie, then am I with you and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite thouſands more, of all men moſt miſerable.<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> As <hi>Nimrod</hi> with his builders were far wide, when they thought with the ſtrength of their hands to worke their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2821:11"/> way to heauen, and the Phariſee when he boaſted of his vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: euen ſo are they that think to obtaine ſaluation by their workes, farre wide, and cleane out of the right way. Like the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> who dealt craftily,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 9.</note> when for the ſafety of their liues they brought old ſackes, old bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and old clouted ſhooes vnto <hi>Ioſua,</hi> as though they had come from far, when they indéed were neighbours: euen ſo doe they deale craftily and ignorantly, that bring workes vnto Chriſt for the ſafety of their ſoules, as though they were auaileable, when indéede they are not. Alas, what is man? man is as light ſéede, or as poyſoned veſſels, whence no wholſome things can procéede. There are thrée ſpeciall things that belongs for your good: Firſt, griefe and ſorrow for ſinnes paſt, and corruptions preſent: The ſecond is Hope or affiance in the promiſes of God in Chriſt: And the third is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie or perſeuerance in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2821:12"/> expectation of Gods mercies. The firſt of theſe you haue: which neuertheleſſe may bring you to ineuitable deſtruction without the other two. Be carefull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſéeke after the meanes of Faith, and then looke for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God to ſanctifie it vnto your vſe: without the which, Faith and all meanes are but bare inſtruments. Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Wee are ſaued by grace thorow Faith, and not of our ſelues:</hi> for it is the gift of God. So then it is plaine, that Grace and Faith are partners, Grace being the firſt, and Faith the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, it comprehends and apprehends paſſiuely the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God in Chriſt, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himſelfe the merits or righteouſnes of Chriſt.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2821:14"/> Heare now with all ſimplicitie and holy feare what Faith is: Faith is a beléeuing of that which is beyond the vſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that which is beyond the vſe of Reaſon, or that which by the power of earthly things can be any way performed, as the conception of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> the miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the miracles of the Prophets, the miracles of the Apoſtles, and the miracles of Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16.7.18.21. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13.2. <hi>King.</hi> 2.4.5.6. <hi>Math, Mar. Luke Ioh.</hi> &amp; ſuch like: The more a man doth reaſon with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or expoſtulate with fleſh and bloud, the more incredible they ſhall ſéeme. In another ſort, as it were more plainly,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith; <hi>Faith is a beleeuing, that thoſe things which now are were not, and that thoſe things which now are not, ſhall be in time to come.</hi> Concerning the firſt branch of Faith, <hi>to wit,</hi> that <hi>thoſe things which now are were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2821:15"/> not,</hi> is to beléeue the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, creatures in the ayre, creatures on the earth, and in the ſeas, which now wee haue vſe of, were not heretofore, and the earth was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with water, or rather there was no earth, and darkneſſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the great déepe. If a man do conſider of theſe things, with the vſe of Reaſon or naturall Philoſophy, hee will conclude and ſay, as <hi>Nichodemus</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> Now ſaith the Apoſtle, you muſt comprehend or attaine to the knowledge of this by Faith. Againe, that all thoſe glorious things which now are were made of nothing, but by the bare word of God, which ſéems more incredible to the naturall man: here then he muſt take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof by Faith. The other branch of Faith, which is a beléeuing that <hi>thoſe things which now are not, ſhall be: to wit,</hi> that the righteous ſhall inherite the ioyes of heauen, and the wicked
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2821:15"/> ſhall be tormented in hell; that the bodies of men good and bad, ſhall riſe at the laſt day, and ſuch like matters, cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the naturall man, therefore he muſt attaine vnto it by Faith. This Faith traines vs to a third kinde of Faith. For in euery Triangle there are thrée lines; the firſt beginneth, the ſecond augmenteth, and the third finiſheth the figure: euen ſo, there are thrée kindes or ſorts of Faith, the firſt is Hiſtoricall, <hi>to wit,</hi> an aſſent to the truth of the Scriptures: the ſecond Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, when a man ſtands partly vpon his works for iuſtification: the third is Euangelicall, <hi>to wit,</hi> a Faith that procéedes from Grace, and thence takes way to the apprehending of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits onely for his iuſtification. This is the true and catholicke Faith, the other may be in the Diuell. This true faith which yéeldeth teſtimonie to Gods word, is battered and bruiſed by many temptations, but neuer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2821:16"/> broken, becauſe it takes hold in méekeneſſe on Chriſt. Hée that hath this faith contents himſelfe with weake meanes, becauſe hée knowes that God is powerfull in them, and hée contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe without meanes, becauſe it is all one with his Maieſtie, and yet hée omits not the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nor any good that is offered. To conclude, this faith is not idle, it worketh by loue, it euer ſanctifieth, and is profitable to euery good worke.</p>

The firſt of which interrogations is; <hi>How ſhall they call on him, in whom they haue not beleeued?</hi> As if hee had ſaid, there is no calling vpon God without faith. The ſecond is, <hi>How ſhall they beleeue on him of whom they haue not heard?</hi> As if hée would ſay, no man can haue Faith without the hearing of Gods word. And the third is; <hi>How can a man heare without a Preacher?</hi> As if he had ſaid, there is no benefit of hearing the word without a preacher. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is then, that Faith commeth by the hearing of Gods word preached. Thus alſo it may be ſaid on the contrary, as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations are laid: Take away the preacher take away the word, take away the word take away hearing, take away hearing take away Faith, take away Faith take away calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, take away calling vpon God take away ſaluation
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2821:19"/> in Chriſt. The ſame Apoſtle in the ſame place, magnifying the miniſtery of Gods word, and the excellencie of things which faith bringeth, cries out emphatically; <hi>O how beautifull are the feete of them that bring tidings of peace!</hi> As if he had ſaid, it is farre more ioyfull, and farre more profitable for a Chriſtian congregation, to ſée a Preacher come amongſt them, becauſe of faith, which they are to receiue by his preaching, then it is to ſée a Prince, who notwithſtanding his great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, muſt himſelfe alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſit downe and ſubmit himſelf to the preaching of Gods word, as the meaneſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for his faith. And againe, the ſame Apoſtle faith; <hi>The Goſpell is the power of God to ſaluation:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> that is to ſay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God be moſt innarrably powerfull in the execution of vengeance againſt the wicked, &amp; in the manifeſtation of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards the godly, and can effect the one and the other which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2821:19"/> way it pleaſeth him: yet he hath tyed and bound himſelfe to the miniſtery of his word preached, and the ſame hée hath made pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and effectuall to life or to death, as a ſauour of life, or as a ſauour of death. As for example, <hi>Cornelius</hi> being a iuſt man,<note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> and one that was endued with many ſingular vertues, yet he wanted faith, which by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Angell, he was to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for, by the preaching of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> God might haue giuen him faith by the miniſtery of the ſame Angell, he might haue giuen him faith by his owne mouth, by the motion of the holy Ghoſt, or by ſome other way: but hée would not, becauſe he had ſanctified and dedicated his holy word for that purpoſe, and hée would ſhew throughout all poſterities, that the preaching of his word, was the onely outward meanes of faith. The like example of the Eunuch,<note place="margin">Acts 8.26.</note> who was reading the Bible with great deſire: God might haue giuen him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2821:20"/> faith by reading, or by the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of an Angell, or by one of his owne company, or by what meanes elſe hée had liſted: but his Maieſtie would not, becauſe he would dignifie his word, and becauſe hee had fixed his force and power in his word, hée would that way onely effect faith in him. And therefore hée ſent <hi>Philip</hi> from farre to preach vnto him: at whoſe preaching hée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede had Faith and was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> by his preaching wonne many to Faith. Chriſt himſelfe and his Apoſtles wonne many to Faith by the preaching of the Goſpell. We haue a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example in <hi>Ezra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nch. 3.8.</note> who hauing read the Law vnto the people, did goe vp into the Pulpit to preach. And what ſhall I ſay more? The Diuell doth know that the preaching of the Goſpell is the meanes of Faith, and Faith the inſtrument of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: therefore he laboureth all that hée can, that it may not be preached When <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:2821:20"/> preached vnto <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the Deputie,<note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer withſtood him, and thought (as the holy Ghoſt ſaith) to turne the Deputie from the Faith. Many pregnant places are for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of which I ſhall not néede to ſpeake. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhewed the Embaſſadours of <hi>Babilon</hi> all his treaſures, and hid nothing from them: euen ſo, good Chriſtian <hi>Pariſhioner,</hi> the King of heauen will ſhew vnto you, by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, all his holy and ſpirituall treaſures, and will hide nothing from you. And as no man vpon the paine of death might come to <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> the great King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rich attyre, and then not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hée was called: ſo no man may come vnto God the King of kings, without faith, and vnleſſe hée be called thereunto by the preaching of his word. Our eares were ſpecially giuen vnto vs, to be as meſſengers and true embaſſadours to the heart. Sounds make not ſuch perfect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2821:21"/> and plauſible diſtinctions vnto our eares, as vnderſtanding words of men: &amp; the beſt words that poſſibly may be vttered by men for our good, are nothing ſo incomprehenſibly and innarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly profitable vnto our eares, &amp; ſo conſequently to our ſoules, as the word of God preached, if the hearing be carefully enrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the heart, becauſe it brings and bréedes Faith, which the words of men or of Angels will not.</p>

                  <p>One anſwere ſerues for them both, <hi>to wit,</hi> that their ſtate of ſaluation is very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous: yea, I may ſay further, their ſtate by the reuealed Word is damnable: the one, becauſe they wilfully refuſe the Word preached, when they may haue it: the other, becauſe they wilfully neglect it. For though they haue not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in their owne Pariſh, by the ignorance or careleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Paſtor, yet in this his Maieſties religious gouernement, they may haue preaching elſe where, not farre
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2821:26"/> off: to theſe I affirme, that priuate or publique reading of Gods word, auaile nothing in the way of ſaluation. And I ſay farther, by whomſoeuer the want of preaching commeth, by the Paſtor, by the People, by the Pope, or by the Prince, it is a foretelling of eternall perdition to that place. <hi>Salomon</hi> after his conuerſion, being directed by the ſpirit of God, entred into ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſideration concerning the euill of ignorance, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of knowledge, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reſolutely, that where the word was not preached, there the people periſhed. How much more they then, that hauing the word preached in their owne pariſh, doe wilfully contemne it: and the other ſort that might haue it in the next Pariſh, and doe willingly neglect it, do mark themſelues with the ſtigmaticall brand of perdition. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe, to ſet forth the benefit of preaching, and the annullitie of publique reading onely, ſaid;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2821:26"/> 
                     <hi>Woe vnto mee if I preach not,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby the great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage done to the people where it was not preached, and the great good that came by preaching. And in the ſame conſiderations he chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> vpon paine of eternall condemnation, to preach, not monethly, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, but euery Sabaoth, in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and out of ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>As the Gadarens and the phariſées wilfully refuſed Chriſt and his merits, when hée was amongſt them, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iuſtly condemned: euen ſo, that ſort of people hauing the preaching of Gods word as a meane of their ſaluation, and wilfully refuſing it, are alſo iuſtly condemned. And as the fooliſh virgins neglecting the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of getting oyle, were ſhut out from heauen when Chriſt the Bridegroome came; and as thoſe gueſts that were inuited to the marriage of Chriſt the Kings ſonne, did all beginne to make excuſe, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2821:27"/> not partakers of that holy and ſpirituall banket: Euen ſo, that other ſort of people that may heare preaching, and doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes content themſelues with reading, doe negligently defraud themſelues of the foode of their ſoules, and ſhall therefore be excluded from heauen. Wée reade that many thouſand ſoules were conuerted to Chriſt, by preaching, at ſundry times, and by hundreds and thouſands at one time: but neuer of any that haue béene conuerted with the reading of Gods word onely. The oppoſition of wicked men, and of the Diuell in all ages of the world, againſt preaching, and his and their quiet allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reading, argueth the extreame euill of ignorance, and the deſtruction that comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preaching. The manifeſt difference betwéene the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of thoſe congregations, where the Word is preached, and where it is not preached, pleades the intollerable want of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2821:27"/> preaching, and the inſufficiencie of publique reading onely. The right vſe of naturall things, as the Ayre, Fire, Water, Bread, and ſuch like, without the which no man can liue, diſplayeth the leanneſſe of their ſoules that want the foode ſpirituall, which is the preaching of Gods word. And the precious Stone <hi>Sanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> is vnſightly to the eye, and vnprofitable for the honour, whiles it is whole: but being broken, it ſhines like the Sunne, and is many wayes commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Euen ſo, the bleſſed Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Almighty God, whiles it is whole, little or nothing auaileth the hearer or the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: but being wiſely diuided, and proportionably deliuered to Gods houſhold, it ouerſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and inlargeth it ſelfe through euery facultie of the ſoule.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2821:46"/> night after night, vpon diuine deliberation. The very title or name giuen to this book imports in effect, this wonderfull worke or creation of almightie God, whence it is called <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that is to ſay, a begetting, generation or creation. And the firſt day he created that ſtately Element of Fire, which he gathered out of the whole maſſe, ſetting it in the heauens as a glorious Globe: whence it is ſaid he made Light, which indéede is nothing elſe but a qualitie of Fire: in which won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull worke hée brought light out of darkneſſe, as an Element impugning the former.

                  <p>The ſecond dayes worke was that liuely Element of the ayre or firmament, or as I may ſay more properly, that vaſte or void place betwixt the earth and the clouds, which made a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt water and water,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2821:47"/> and which giues breath and life to all liuing things.</p>
                  <p>The third day he made the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water, which hée cauſed to retire into more proper places, which fitly according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie thereof, was called the Seas, <hi>to wit,</hi> a gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of waters. The fourth Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Earth, which according to the qualitie thereof was called Dry land, was alſo made, and ſo continueth as vpon a firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. The generall creation of compound bodies were ordained for the inhabitants of this great element, Earth. In this general earthly creation, his Maieſtie goeth forward, as from things that were vnperfect, to that which was perfecter, till at laſt he came to the moſt perfect: as from trées, hearbs, and plants, which haue onely life (whereby they grow and increaſe) vnto beaſts, which haue an increaſing and a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life, and from thence to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> who hath a reaſonable life with the increaſing and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2821:47"/> which Element of Earth his diuine Maieſtie ſtored with all kinde of commodities méete for the vſe of mankinde, to be and to remaine for euer. This order of Creation vpon a ſodaine view may ſeeme ſtrange, <hi>to wit,</hi> that God made corne, graſſe, trées, hearbes, and ſuch like to grow, and to haue their being before ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies, as the Sunne, the Moone and Starres, whence corne, graſſe, and ſuch like, haue their growth and influence. But being rightly and aduiſedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the Almighty Creator ſhewes that increaſe, propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; preſeruation of all things conſiſts onely in him and by him, and not from the vertue of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall creatures, as men haue imagined and ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>The fourth day God made lights, the Sunne to rule the day, the Moone and the Starres to gouerne the night: both which are very great, that they might the better giue light to the darke earth, being ſo farre from the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2821:48"/> heauens. Theſe two great orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the heauens doe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt day and night, the moneth from the yeare, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from another, and ſummer from winter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt day and night, hée created in the night fiſhes, in the day, birds.</p>
                  <p>Fiſhes were compounded of the foure elements, eſpecially of the element of water: whence it commeth that they liue in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>Birds were made of all foure elements, but eſpecially of the ayre: whence it comes that they take pleaſure in the ayre.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt day and night he made all ſorts of beaſts, ſome to goe, and ſome to créepe, ſome wilde, ſome tame: God then made man in both kindes plurally, <hi>to wit,</hi> male and female, and yet of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle bodies, the better to helpe one another, and therefore ſaid, <hi>It is not good for man to be alone, I will make him an helper like vnto himſelfe.</hi> He was made after all
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2821:48"/> other creatures, that hée might in the beholding thereof laud and magnifie his Creator. The whole Trinitie deliberated and conſulted concerning him, which he did not concerning any other creature.</p>
                  <p>The ſeauenth day God dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by his owne reſt and ceaſing from labour, for an euerlaſting reſt amongſt all poſterities.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2821:55"/> or an hidden iuſtice, inforcing to doe well. It was indéede the ſum and effect of Gods diuine law, which was moſt liuely expreſſed in the names of thoſe ten holy Fathers, who being linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, makes vp a Chriſtian Sacrifice, or an holy ſumme of true religion. As he is not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckoned a man that wants reaſon: ſo hée was not then rightly reckoned to be of God, that wanted this religious rule. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, as the eternall power and godhead, by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, maketh all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, without excuſe, though they had no law: euen ſo men knowing the end of their creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the law of nature, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe if they doe euil, though they were blinde and ſaw not the creation. The Gentiles, ſaid hée, that had not the Law written, did by nature the things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law; they hauing not the law written, were a law vnto themſelues: euen ſo the people of the old world, and others, that

As a good ſonne in all his troubles, affianceth his repoſe in his father: as a ſtaffe ſupporteth a trauailer in his dangerous wayes: and as pillers ſupport earthly buildings: euen ſo theſe Iewes, by faithfull obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and miniſtration of theſe Ceremonies were maintained, ſupported and defended vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ioyes through Chriſt.

We reade that nothing can bruiſe the Adamant, but the warme bloud of a Goat: euen ſo in the holy Scriptures, wée finde, though no Ceremony could bruiſe <hi>Belials</hi> bands, yet the blood of Ieſus Chriſt hath bruiſed, and burſt them into péeces.

                  <p>The vſe and profit is twofold: one is an humbling of all ſorts at the feet of God. For when our ſinnes are gathered together, as it were on an heape, and the entrance into our owne vnableneſſe to make a kinde of ſatiſfaction, it muſt néedes ſtrike a feare and a confuſion into our hearts, and thereby proſtrate vs before God.

                     <hi>Saul</hi> in like manner tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the voyce of the Lord, in keeping the King of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites aliue, whereas hée was commanded to kill him, and in reſeruing for Sacrifice, the beſt of the Oxen, and the beſt of the Sheepe, which was alſo directly forbidden. Out of which place I will anſwere your demaund or queſtion from the mouth of <hi>Samuel</hi> the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <hi>When thou waſt little in thine owne ſight, waſt not thou made King ouer Iſraell? The Lord commanded thee to kill the Amalekites, and to let none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: Now thou haſt not obeyed the Lords voyce, but haſt turned to the prey: wherein thou haſt done wickedly in the ſight of the Lord. Rebellion is as the ſinne of witchcraft, and tranſgreſſion is wickedneſſe and Idolatry. Behold, thou haſt caſt away the word of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2821:96"/> Lord: therefore hee hath caſt away thee.</hi> Hereby you may ſée that ſinne or tranſgreſſion is not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned for the ſmalneſſe or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, with God, as it is with men: for many times ſmall ſinnes in our ſights are great ſinnes in Gods fight: and great ſinnes in our fight are ſmall in his ſight. Men muſt rule them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by his word, by his holy Lawes, and not according to good intents, or earthly mens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond part or roome of the Temple, was called <hi>Holy,</hi> becauſe none might enter into it but the Prieſts, who were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and they were diſtinguiſhed into <hi>24.</hi> Orders.

Neare thereto was an Ile that did pertaine to the Gentiles, and to all people cleane &amp; vncleane: therfore it was called the court of the Gentiles.

                     <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Nebat</hi> an Ephradite of <hi>Zere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Salomons</hi> Seruant. He was a ſtrong man and valiant. The Prophet <hi>Ahijah</hi> fore-tolde him by a ſigne, that the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be diuided into two parts, and that he ſhould be king
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2821:115"/> of the one part. <hi>Salomon</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof ſought to kill him: which made him to flye into Egypt. But when <hi>Salomon</hi> was dead, it fell out ſo indéede, as you may read: for hée had ten Tribes that held with him, where as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the lawfull heyre, and the Kings ſonne, had but two Tribes. Which fauour at Gods hands might haue made him humble, and zealous after religion, but hée imagined, that if the people did ſerue the Lord (as they vſed) at Ieruſalem, they would turne and rebell. Therefore hée made them Idols at Bethel and Dan, and ordained them prieſts of the inferiour ſort of people, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the people to worſhip thoſe Idols for their God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he thought to haue done wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but the Prophet reprehended him in the open congregation, and the Lord ſtrucke that hand of his wherewith he would haue ſtricken the Prophet, with ſuch
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2821:116"/> numneſſe or drineſſe, as he was not able to helpe himſelfe. And the Altar claue a ſunder at that time, as the man of God deſired. Then the King was fayne to make interceſſion vnto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that God would reſtore him his hand. And at another time, the Prophet <hi>Ahijah</hi> tolde him as from the Lord: that for the wickedneſſe hée had done to prouoke his Maieſtie withall, there ſhould not be left of him, nor of his generation ſo much as one. Dogges ſhould eate his ſtocke in the Citie, and the Fowles of the ayre in the field. Hée raigned two and twenty yeares, and then dyed.</p>

                  <p>There is great vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For if you compare the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of euery ſeuerall Prophet, with the religion and manners of the king, and the people vnder whom they propheſied, the one
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2821:136"/> doth plainely expound the other.

The laſt Degrée that I handled, doth concerne the time in which the people were in captiuitie: and this Degrée concernes the time from the end of their Captiuitie vntill the finiſhing of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And the three Prophets annexed vnto them, were ſuch as God gaue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and to ſet them forward in their building, and in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Bookes olde and new, for matter chiefly contained
